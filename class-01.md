    - The article element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and
      potentially be syndicated.
        * a forum post, blog post etc...
    - The nav element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the
      primary site navigation.
    - the aside element has 2 purposes
        1. When the aside element is used inside an article element, it should contain information that is related to the
           article but not essential to its overall meaning.
        2. When the aside element is used outside of an article element, it acts as a container
           for content that is related to the entire page.
    - The purpose of the hgroup element is to group together a set of one or more h1 through
      h6 elements so that they are treated as one single heading.
