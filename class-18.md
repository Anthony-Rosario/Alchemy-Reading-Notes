# Read 05b: Problem Solving and Better Questions

* Problem Solving Skills

1. Problem solving has always been a big downfall of mine. Not neccessarily in my everyday life
   but when I am required to approach a subject logically I kind of fumble ideas around in my head.
   I tend to not be as open-minded as mentioned in the article and I am my biggest pragmatic critic
   and slowly working on overcoming that. I also struggle with taking breaks lol. Sometimes I will just sit in my room
   for like 4 hours working on my lab which is not healthy...
