1. can position and alter elements with the transform property. 
    - comes in 2 dimensional and 3 dimensional
2. rest of the chapter lists detailed description on how to manipulate 
   objects using different css properties.

* Transitions & Animations

1. There are four transition related properties in total, including transition-property, 
   transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay
2. It is important to note, not all properties may be transitioned, 
   only properties that have an identifiable halfway point.
3. Colors, font sizes, and the alike may be transitioned from one value to 
   another as they have recognizable values in-between one another.
4. When transitioning multiple properties you can set multiple durations, one for each property.


* Articles about different CSS animations

1. The articles that Sara Vierra does also interest me because they are so freaking useful and cool.
   Especially these transitions. I was always under the impression that people used generators to make 
   these cool animations.
