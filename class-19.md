# NODE.js

* An intro to Node

1. Node uses an open-source JAvaScript engine that runs in chomrium based browsers that is responsible 
   for compilling JavaScript directly to native executable code. 
2. blocking I/O calls should be avoided, CPU-intensive operations should be handed off to a worker thread,
   and errors should always be handled correctly for fear of crashing the entire process.
3. Node makes it possible to process files as they are being uploaded.
