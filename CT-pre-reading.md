# Research: Prework

* Clean Code - Robert Martin

1. I had no idea the impact of a messy codebase. I always thought overhauling it would be relatively smooth 
   until I read a part where it took a company 10+ years... Definitely going to read the entire thing when I 
   get some down time.


* Test Driven Development By Example - Kent Beck

1. While reading this all I was thinking to myself was how important test driven development is and how often 
   I don't code in that way. I find testing to be a very gray area to me and need to work on it tremendously. 
   I also felt a little overwhelmed with the money example but I'll get there hopefully. 


* Quantity Always Trumps Quality - Jeff Atwood

1. This little article had some profound advice. I tend to lack the ability of a continuous workflow regarding hobbies. 


* Look up Cunninghamâ€™s Law - Ward Cunningham

1. While reading about this, and then googling examples of it, made me question how smart a troll really is. 
   Definitely going to take this into consideration when asking for advice in forums.
