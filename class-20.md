# Readings: REST

* What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

1. A great in-depth article about team dynamics. After countless studies and hours of data review 
   google struggled to find a pattern that correlated to a groups success rate. This reminds of my time 
   training new hires at Nordstrom and how there was always 1 or two people that didnt know how to work together
   constructively. I'm sure that its incredibly diffrerent from a warehouse environment and I can't wait to 
   compare the two.


* How I explained REST to my brother

1. I thoroughly enjoyed this article and will use it as a reference if someone asks what REST means.
   Especially the part talking about using the verb universally on different nouns. Incredible
   analogy honestly.
