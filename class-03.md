# JavaScript Book

* Review from Reading 02 - Chapter 2: “Basic JavaScript Instructions”

1. creatig an array
    - const colors;
      colors = [white, orange, purple];
      const el = document.elementById('colors')
      el.textContent = colors[0]
    - new Array('white ',
                'black',
                'custom');
      var el = document.getElementByid( ' colors' );
      el.innerHTML = colors.item(O);
2. Number starts at 0 in an array
3. Can change values with .textContent property. 


* Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops” from switch statements on 

1. IF.... else statements check conditions
    - if the first condition isnt met then it runs the next line of code
    - if the first code block is true then the first code block executes.
2. Switch statements start with a variable called the switch value
    - the switch value is the value in the parens after switch()
    - if the value of the variable equals the case argument then that caase is executed
3. switch satements provide better performance on the backend
4. Logical opperators process things from left to right and as soon as they reach the result 
   it short-circuits (stops the code)
5. loops checks a condition
    - if it returns true the code runs, then it keeps checking the code to see if it still returns true
    - if you need to run code a specific nubmer of times use a for loop
    - if you dont know how many times the code needs to run use a while loop
    - do while loops are similar to while loopps but always run the code at least once even if the condition evaluates to false
6. a for loops uses a counter as a condidition, which instructs the code to run a specified number of times
